# you-make-the-play

## Background
One card from this 90-card set was inserted into each Series One pack. Forty-five players are featured on two different cards. The cards measure just about the standard-size but have rounded corners and were meant to be played as part of a game.

In addition to being inserted into packs, dealers also were offered extra You Make the Play cards depending on how many cases ordered. A dealer who ordered one case received two 12-card packs of these cards for a total of 24 cards. Meanwhile, a dealer who ordered two cases received six 12-card packs for a total of 72 packs.

Customers could also receive 12 of these cards by sending 10 wrappers and $2 to an a mail-in order. This offer expired on May 15, 1996.

This set is also available in a Gold Signature parallel.
